<p><a href='http://code.google.com/p/renjin'>Renjin</a> is a new interpeter for the R language
that runs on the JVM. It's principle goal is to facilitate the use of R-language programs and
libraries in a wider variety of environments, such as Google AppEngine, on which this example
is running.</p>

<p>Renjin is meant to be 100% compatible with R 2.10.1 (we'll move onto newer versions eventually)
but not all primitive functions are implemented.
